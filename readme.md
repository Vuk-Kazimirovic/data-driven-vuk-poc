This README provides instructions for executing a test using Cypress, a popular JavasCript end-toend testing framework.

#Prerequisites

Before executing the Cypress test, make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (version 12 or above)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

#Setup

1. Clone or download the project repository containing your Cypress test code.
2. Open terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory.
3. Install the project dependencies by running the following command: npm install

#Configuring the test

1. Open the 'cypress.json' file located in the project's root directory.
2. Update the '"baseURL"' property to match the base URL of the application you want to test. For example:

{
    "baseURL": "https://localhost:3000"
}

3. Review the other available configuration options in 'cypress.json' to customize your test execution if necessary.

#Executing the test

1. In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project's root directory if you haven't already.
2. To launch the Cypress Test Runner, run the following command: npx cypress open
This will open the Cypress Test Runner GUI.
3. Choose e2e testing and a browser you want to test through.
4. Click on the test file you want to execut in the Cypress Test Runner (e.g. 'testName.js')
5. Wait for the browser window to open and observe the test execution.

#Running tests in headless mode

If you prefer to run the tests in headless mode (without the graphical interface), you can use the following command: npx cypress run

This will execute the tests in the terminal and provide the test results without launching the Cypress Test Runner GUI.

#Further customization

To further customize your tests, you can explore the Cypress documentation which provides detailed information on writing and organizing tests, interacting with elements, handling assertions and more. Visit the official Cypress website at https://docs.cypress.io for comprehensive documentation and guides.

#Conclusion

By following the instructions in this README, you should be able to execute your Cypress tests and validate the behaviour of your application. Happy testing!
